# Probabilistic Fire Simulator (PFS)

PFS is an engineering tool for probabilistic fire risk assessment. It is implemented as a Microsoft Excel workbook with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) subroutines for statistics and interfacing with Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). PFS is developed by researchers at Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. 

Applications 
- User interface for creating FDS input files 
- Framework for running Monte Carlo fire simulations and post-processing the results 
- Supports standard, nested and two-model Monte Carlo simulations 

Supported fire models 
- Fire Dynamics Simulator 
- Excel worksheet models (i.e. analytical and probabilistic models)
